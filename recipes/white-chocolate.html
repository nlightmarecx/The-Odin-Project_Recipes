    <h1>White Chocolate</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"While it might not be the type of chocolate you want to chow down on in candy 
        bar form, white chocolate is a perfect medium for dipping fruit or pretzels, 
        fondue-style; as a foundation for chocolate bark; or for a decorative 
        glaze on cakes and cookies."</p>
    <p>"But to do any of those delicious things with white chocolate, you’ve got to melt it first.</p>
    <h3>How to melt a chocolate?</h3>
    <p>"Our recommendation is microwave. The microwave method is quick but hands-on. 
        You’ll need to check the chocolate and stir in intervals to make sure it 
        doesn’t overcook and burn. Depending on the power of your microwave, you 
        may want to adjust the interval timing slightly. All microwaves are 
        different, and you’ll learn the sweet spot for yours the more you use it.</p>
