    <h1>White Chocolate Buttermint Ice Cream</h1>
    <img src="../Images/choco-drink.jpg"/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"A few months ago, I had some of this buttermint ice cream at Jeni’s 
        with Ashley. No… it’s not normally any sort of flavor that I’d usually 
        get. It doesn’t have chocolate or caramel or bacon or sprinkles or peanut 
        butter chunks. It doesn’t have ribbons of fudge or cubes of cake. But it 
        just so happened to be one of the 14 flavors that I sampled before making 
        my decision (typical)… and I couldn’t get it out of my head."</p>
    <p>"This ice cream… I mean, it’s turning me into an ice cream person. It’s 
        40 thousand times better than those mints. And it’s not super minty – 
        it has just a slight hint of mint and is so buttery and creamy – it 
        literally melts in your mouth. No, really… SO BUTTERY AND CREAMY. Oh, 
        and the fact that there are white chocolate flecks speckled through 
        the ice cream? Yeah. I dieeeee."</p>

                    cheese with salt and turmeric until smooth.</li>
