    <img src="../Images/raspberry.jpg"/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"let’s get the party started for these white chocolate raspberry 
        mousse cups. It’s a week away from Valentine’s Day and we need 
        more desserts in our life."</p>
    <p>"For this white chocolate raspberry parfait, I whipped up a vanilla 
        bean mousse with some melted white chocolate folded in. It’s so 
        rich and delicious. Add a ripple of fresh raspberry sauce and some 
        raspberries and you have yourself a beautiful mini dessert."</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 ½ cups raspberries,</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar,</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice,</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine 
                the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice. Bring 
                to a simmer over medium-high heat, mashing 
                the berries with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and press through a fine-mesh 
                sieve using the back of a spoon. Collect sauce 
                in a bowl. Refrigerate until cold.</li>
            <li>Divide half of the mousse among 6 small glasses 
                or ramekins. Top with each with a tablespoon of 
                cooled raspberry sauce and a few raspberries.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining mousse, sauce, and raspberries. 
                Sprinkle with shaved white chocolate. Refrigerate 
                until cold, at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
